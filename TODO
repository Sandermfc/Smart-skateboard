(DONE) - Get height values accurately using accel/gyro instead of with ultrasound sensors
(DONE) - Complete rewrite of all tester functors
(DONE) - Output to bluetooth (find a library that doesnt interfere with "math.h"
- Scale the height value to meters
- Try and make height calculation more accurate (possibly take an average of multiple readings from FIFObuffer to negate margin of error)
- Apply a points system.
